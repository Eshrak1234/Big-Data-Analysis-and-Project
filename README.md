# Big-Data-Analysis-and-Project
The libraries used in this project is- 
1. Pandas- Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis
2. Numpy- It is used for numerical operations
3. Matplotlib.pyplot- This library is used for plotting visualizations
4. Seaborn- It is used for advanced statistical visualizations
5. Sklearn.preprocessing- From this StandardScaleris used to normalize the data. 
6. Sklearn.impute- This library is used for handling missing values.
7. Sklearn.decomposition - Used for PCA for dimensionality reduction
8. Sklearn.cluster - To apply clustering algorithms like KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering
9. Sklearn.mixture - For GaussianMixture model

Steps
1. First of all the dataset is loaded using Pandas
2. Dataset shape, Missing values, class dribution and feature summary are checked which are called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Clustering Techniques like K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Hierarchical Clustering are applied Each of them have cluster visualisation and cluster statistics.
4. Visualisations techniques were applied. Correlation Matrix and Heatmap, Pie-Chart, Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model
